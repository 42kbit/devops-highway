This is my dummy attempt to write DevOps configs for stuff mentioned below.
Who knows, maybe someday, someone, will find this repo useful :T

CC0 - NO RIGHTS RESERVED

Expect here following:

Git (come on it hosted using git)
Terraform
AWS (with terraform and others)
Ansible
Jenkins or Github Actions
Kubernates

Ideas:
- Ansible project that sets up wireguard vpn on given vps (ec2 instance)
- HTTPS Website, on aws, with load balancers and other funnys (done i guess)
